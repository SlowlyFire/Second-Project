# Second-Project

in this project we have some functions we implement.  
I will explain each one of the functions, and demonstrate with examples.  
  

## Tower Of Hanoi (function 1):  

for explanation about what is it the tower of hanoi, you can enter the following link:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi  

basically, the function gets number of disks and 3 rods, and prints the way you have to move the disks between
the rods by the rules, when all disks starts at rod A, and end in rod C.  
disk 1 is the smallest one, and disk n is the biggest one.  
**we should notice that all disks are arranged in rod A from biggest disk at the bottom to smallest disk on top.**   
and now we should move them to rod C to be arranged exactly the same, but only by the following rules.

the golden rules of hanoi tower:  
1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.  
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.  
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.  

examples:
1. number of disks: 2, 3 rods (A, B, C):
